<p><font size="+1">In college, David took classes in
arcane subjects, ranging
from Sanskrit to Aztec cannibalism to primate behavior. Actually, he
probably
took one too many anthropology classes for his own good. As a result he
tends to re-examine the myths in our own culture with an odd vision, as
well as inventing his own legends and tall tales. He believes that the
myths of any culture must be retold for every new generation because of
changes in technology and the environment and our understanding of
them.
For instance, Paul Bunyon, the giant who chopped down thousands of
trees
daily, was an appropriate hero for a culture in the midst of clearing
land
for agriculture and settlements. However, nowadays in the United States
it is more heroic to plant and preserve forests than to destroy them.
One
of the many paintings and stories David has in his head but not in the
real world in a retelling of the Paul Bunyon legend, with the giant
recast
as something less than a hero.</font>
</p>
<p><font size="+1">&nbsp;Many of his "New Myths"
revolve around Mother Nature.
In David's vision, she left Earth unattended too long while partying at
an intergalactic soiree. She receives the news that things are going
wrong
and must come flying back through space still in her party dress (and
understandably
upset) to discover that humans have evolved too far and have began
depleting
the ozone, killing off the buffalo, and clearcutting forests, and so
she
must begin repairs and education. "Fixing the Ozone." is a part of this
tale, and is more prayer than story.</font>
