David Martinez, Painting</h1></center>

<div class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>David's goal is to
create and illustrate a new mythology. His themes are drawn from both modern
and ancient sources and he is equally inspired by physicists (such as Einstein,
Bohr, and Feynman) and goddesses (such as Nut, Innana, and La Virgin de
Guadalupe).<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>David is a native of Austin, Texas. He
divides his time between working as a freelance handy man and painting
on his front porch. Most of his paintings illustrate a legend or historical
event, but the legends vary as widely as do his interests. David has started
a series on Mother Nature, portraying her in scenes ranging from an explanation
of the origin of woodpeckers, to her fixing the ozone layer, to her flying
back from an intergalactic party after hearing that the life on Earth had
gotten out of hand. He has also written a tongue in cheek Just So story
explaining spiders' sometimes dangerous mating habits - and painted an
illustration for it.
<br>David likes to read biographies - especially those of scientists and
philosopher kings. His most recent inspirations have come from the field
of physics, resulting in one painting of David's pick for the four most
relevant physicists this century, and one of four of the men responsible
for the first atomic bomb. He's written brief histories of the people portrayed
in these paintings, as well as a sketchy background of the subject.&nbsp;</span>
