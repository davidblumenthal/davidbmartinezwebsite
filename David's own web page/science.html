David has begun a series of paintings inspired by various scientists
and their work. <a href="Scntsts.html">Einstein and
the Quantum Jumpers</a>
is a painting of the four physicists David believes symbolize the most
important
theories in physics to emerge this century. Each of the scientists is
shown in the colors of his home country. <a href="Trinity.html">
The Trinity Test</a> is a landscape
with four of the men responsible for ushering us into the Atomic Age
standing against a backdrop of the first hydrogen bomb test in New
Mexico. </font>
<p><font size="4">David has completed two paintings
that celebrate mathematicians who discovered equations describing
fractals: <a href="Feigenbaum.html">Feigenbaum</a>
and <a href="mandelbrot.html">Mandelbrot</a>.
<br>
</font>
</p>
<p><font size="4">David has written an explanation
of the major players in each of these paintings, as well as some
background for the events. Of course, some people will disagree with
his choice of scientists. (David had many arguments with his
father-in-law over which physicists to choose for the Quantum Jumpers).<br>
