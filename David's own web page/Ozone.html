We regret that, in out ignorance, we have polluted the air and have harmed the layer that protects all life.  Please forgive us; we have dirtied what we cannot clean.  We need you to generate new ways to cleanse this planet because we have upset the old balance of nature.  Please guide a cosmic ray to strike a tree just in the right gene so that it mutates and starts making an organic compound that willl fix the hole in the ozone.  We promise to protect and to plant as many trees as we can.  We love our home planet and will do all in our power to preserve what we cannot create.  <B>Amen.</B>     <P><A HREF="index.html">David B.
