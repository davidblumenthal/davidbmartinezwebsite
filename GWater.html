They went up to Black Mountain to look for the turquoise hidden high up the peak.  They didnot realize that a long hot spell had dried up all the springs, so they soonran out of water.  They were delirious with thirst when they got lost.   They could not decide which way to go to find water.  Each was so sure thathe alone knew the right way to go that they argued and separated for thefirst time ever.  Each went in a different direction.  First they walked,then as they weakened, they could only crawl.  After many twists in theirseparate paths,  they all saw the same lake shimmering in the sun.  Withdwindling strength they crawled down to the water.<P>  It was Ghostwater flat.  Cool and hot air layers acted like a magic screenand made the dry desert floor look like a lake.  They met in dust, not water. The boys had enough spunk to laugh when they realized they had been fooled.<P>   They return to Ghostwater every year on this night.  They now often go tofun bone people parties, but save Harvest Night to celebrate together.<P><P><A HREF="index.html">David B.
